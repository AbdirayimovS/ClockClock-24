# Clock

ClockClock 24 - Dada Blue consists of a handcrafted housing of mineral composite and electronic components. It is built on proprietary technology—in both software and hardware—which a team of in-house designers, engineers, and programmers has continuously developed since its inception. The objects are carefully hand-assembled at the studio in Stockhl.vvvvvvvvvvv
